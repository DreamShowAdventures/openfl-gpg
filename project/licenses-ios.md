        In jurisdictions which do not recognize Public Domain property (e.g. Germany as of

        conditions of the MIT License (see below), or 3) under the terms of dual
        Public Domain/MIT License conditions described here, as they choose.

        The MIT License is about as close to Public Domain as a license can get, and is
        described in clear, concise terms at:

        The MIT license is compatible with both the GPL and commercial
        software, affording one all of the rights of Public Domain with the
        minor nuisance of being required to keep the above copyright notice
        and license text in the source code. Note also that by accepting the
        Public Domain "license" you can re-license your copy using whatever
        license you like.
