Haxe bindings for Google Play Games Services, via OpenFL. MIT licensed.

## Info

* This is a WIP, and is not guaranteed to work. Not all functions are implemented.
* If you'd like to request a function be added, please open an issue. If you have a fix or improvement, please submit a pull request.

## Usage

Add `openfl-gpg` to haxelib.

````
haxelib git openfl-gpg https://github.com/DreamShowAdventures/openfl-gpg
````

Add it to your `Project.xml`.

````
<haxelib name="openfl-gpg"/>
````

Other stuff will go here too I guess. This readme is incomplete!

## Building

If you want to build this from the source, you can run `project/make.bat` in Windows to rebuild the Android binaries. This requires a recent version of the Android NDK, which you can get [here](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html).
