Haxe bindings for Google Play Games Services, via OpenFL. MIT licensed.

## Info

* This is a WIP, and is not guaranteed to work. Not all functions are implemented.
* If you'd like to request a function be added, please open an issue. If you have a fix or improvement, please submit a pull request.

## Usage

Add `openfl-gpg` to haxelib.

````
haxelib git openfl-gpg https://github.com/DreamShowAdventures/openfl-gpg

Add it to your `Project.xml`.

Other stuff will go here too I guess. This readme is incomplete!
